The goal of the "VisHyp" package is to visualize hyperparameter performance dependencies in order to gain insight into which hyperparameter configurations deliver the best performance. For this purpose, the following four plots were created: The Partical Coordinate Plot (PCP), the Partial Dependence Plot (PDP), the Importance Plot and the Heatmap. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of VisHyp from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Pizzaknoedel/visualize-hyperparameter")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to plot the four implemented graphics. Each plot needs a task created with the [mlr3](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3) package.

```{r example, warning = FALSE, messages = FALSE, }
## basic example code
library(VisHyp)
library(mlr3)
task = TaskRegr$new(id = "task_glmnet", backend = glmnet_ela, target = "logloss")

## PCP: In the Parallel Coordinate Plot, each line represents a configuration and the color of the line represents the corresponding performance value. The Parallel Coordinate Plot helps to find configuration spaces that contain good performance values. 
plotParallelCoordinate(task)

## Heatmap: The heat map contrasts two parameters and allows quick examination of the effects of each configuration combination. The importance plot uses a surrogate learner to represent the importance of each parameter.
plotHeatmap(task, gridsize = 5)

## Importance Plot: The important parameters should be set as optimal as possible to get a good performance. To last still the partial Dependence Plot was implemented, with which it is possible to examine the individual definition areas of the parameters with the help of a Surrogats model.
plotImportance(task)

## PDP: The Partial Dependence Plot uses different graphics. So it depends on whether the user wants to look at one or more features. When viewing a numerical parameter, line plots are used. 
plotPartialDependence(task)
```

```{r} 
knitr::include_graphics("D:/Simon/Desktop/Studium/6. Semester/Bachelorarbeit/Latex/Grafiken/lcbench_Best_PCP.png")
```

```r 
# After downloading the package it is also possible to visualize hyperparameter dependencies with an integrated shiny app. Just write
launchVisHyp()
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
